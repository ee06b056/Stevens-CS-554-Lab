                <h2>Pokemon:</h2>
                <p>Pokémon (Japanese: ポケモン Hepburn: Pokemon, Japanese: [pokemoɴ]; English: /ˈpoʊkɪˌmɒn, -ki-, -keɪ-/), also known as Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター) in Japan, 
                    is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. 
                    The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,
                     and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. 
                     The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch 'Em All".</p>
                <h2>Berries:</h2>
                <p>Berries (Japanese: きのみ Tree Fruit) are small, juicy, fleshy fruit. As in the real world, a large variety exists in the Pokémon world, with a large range of flavors, names, and effects. 
                    First found in the Generation II games, many Berries have since become critical held items in battle, where their various effects include HP and status condition restoration, stat enhancement, and even damage negation.</p>
                <h2>Machines:</h2>
                <p>Machines are the representation of items that teach moves to Pokémon. They vary from version to version, so it is not certain that one specific TM or HM corresponds to a single Machine.</p>
